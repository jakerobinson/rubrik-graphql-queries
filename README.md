# rubrik-graphql-queries

All sample queries in this repo have 2 qualities:

1. Variables - All queries expose a simple set of variables, opposed to requiring a complex "input" object.
2. Objects Alias - All queries alias the query name as `objects` making automated parsing easier for the sample clients.

See the `examples` folder for different example methods of executing these queries.
